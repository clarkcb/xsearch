Test file

This is a file to test xsearch, which currently has the following 21 implementations:

1. cljsearch for Clojure
2. cppsearch for C++
3. cssearch for C#
4. dartsearch for Dart
5. exsearch for Elixir
6. fssearch for F#
7. gosearch for Go
8. hssearch for Haskell
9. javasearch for Java
10. jssearch for JavaScript (Node.js)
11. ktsearch for Kotlin
12. objcsearch for Objective-C
13. phpsearch for PHP
14. plsearch for Perl
15. ps1search for PowerShell
16. pysearch for Python
17. rbsearch for Ruby
18. rssearch for Rust
19. scalasearch for Scala
20. swiftsearch for Swift
21. tssearch for TypeScript


The basic code structure includes these elements:

* Searcher - executes the file search based on the SearchSettings
* SearchOptions - loads option data from XML, generates usage text, builds a
  SearchSettings instance from command line arguments
* SearchResult - encapsulates a single search result
* SearchSettings - encapsulates the search settings, including what
  directories or files to include/exclude, search patterns, lines before or
  after, etc., used by Searcher


Other possible implementations:

* adasearch for Ada
* erlsearch for Erlang
* jlsearch for Julia


This is the second-to-last line of the test file. The final line is blank.
